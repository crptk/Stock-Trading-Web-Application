# 📈 Stock Trading Simulator  

### 🏆 Overview  
This is a **stock trading simulator** built with **Flask, SQLite, and the Yahoo Finance API** as part of my **CS50 coursework**. It allows users to **simulate buying and selling stocks** with an imaginary balance, track transactions, and view real-time market prices.

### 🎯 Features

✅ **Buy & Sell Stocks** – Trade using a simulated balance  
✅ **Portfolio Management** – Displays owned stocks and their performance  
✅ **Transaction History** – Logs all buy/sell transactions for tracking  
✅ **Balance Management** – Shows available funds and updates after each trade  
✅ **Error Handling** – Displays appropriate messages for invalid actions

- **SQLite** – Stores user accounts, transactions, and balances  
- **Yahoo Finance API** – Fetches real-time stock market data
